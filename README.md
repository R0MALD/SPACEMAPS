# NASA Hackathon Project: Global Rocket Launches and CO2 Emissions Mapping

## Description

Our NASA Hackathon project presents an interactive web application that maps global rocket launches and their associated CO2 emissions. Users can explore launch sites, view launch details, and gain insights into the environmental impact of space exploration. Key features include:

- **Interactive Map:** Discover rocket launch sites worldwide on an interactive 2D map.
- **3D CO2 Emission Renders:** Visualize CO2 emissions in 3D representations for a more immersive experience.
- **Launch Details:** Scroll through launch sites to access comprehensive launch information, Emissions and location.
- **Environmental Insights:** Learn about the environmental consequences of each launch, with CO2 emission data prominently displayed.

The project utilizes NASA's launch data and EPA estimates for CO2 emissions, providing an informative and engaging platform to explore rocket launches and contribute to discussions on sustainable space exploration.

The project is based on a fork of the [WebGL Globe project](https://github.com/dataarts/webgl-globe), which provides the foundational framework for our interactive map.
